# Week 3

Hours worked: 

- Work on implementing core functionality has continued. I started with implementing the priority queue, since JS doesn't have a native implementation of it.
- Comprehensive unit testing of the code. Latest report available in [the testing document](./testing.md).
- ESLint in use as a code quality tool.
